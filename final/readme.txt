Application: Length Converter

My application is ment to convert lengths into other units of lengths that the are providing via radio buttons.
In this assignment I learned basically how to make a widget and fill it with radio buttons, align things with a grid composition in the frame, and basically a small basic understandsing of Ruby/Tk.

SideNote: I couldn't get the arrow key bindings to work, it sems that was out of my league, and the unit label I couldn't get to work either, but if I figure out how to get the bloody thing to work with strings before the deadline then I'll just resubmit it.
